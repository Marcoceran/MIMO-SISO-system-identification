# MIMO-SISO-system-identification
This project is part of the Advanced Digital Signal Processing exam at Polimi. The goal is to perform system identification on several different SISO and MIMO filters, and to estimate the length of the estimated filter that minimizes the mean square error with different levels of noise. Wiener filters are also estimated for the SISO filters.
